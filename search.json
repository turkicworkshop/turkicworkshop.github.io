At the Tunnel Bar in Northampton MA, someone initially suggested “tutu” as the nickname. Inspired by regex, someone else suggested “Tu+”, and it sounded better.\nLosing a third of the alliteration but gaining in neutrality, Paloma Jeretič and Yağmur Sağ changed the name in 2019 to what it is now. Paloma and Yağmur also arranged for the Linguistic Society of America to publish our proceedings."
